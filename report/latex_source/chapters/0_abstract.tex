Forecasting future sales is important to retailers for managing inventory and making marketing decisions. 
Product sales are affected by many external factors, which must be considered when forecasting future sales.
In this paper, the effects of these factors were directly taken into account in the four models created.
These four models include three singular models, consisting of LSTM, MLP, and LGBM, as well as a hybrid model.
The hyperparameters of the singular models were optimized using Bayesian optimization.
Furthermore, we aimed to provide 28-days ahead sale forecasts, by forecasting one day at a time.
The LGBM model was able to achieve the best performance, followed by the hybrid model.
The outstanding results of the LGBM model shows the potential of boosting methods in improving the overall performance.
Moreover, the LSTM model was able to outperform the MLP model, which demonstrates the ability of LSTM networks in learning from time-series data. \newline
